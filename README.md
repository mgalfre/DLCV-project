This repository contains the notebooks, python files and data folders created for the Final Group Project of the Deep Learning for Computer Vision course. They are organized as follows:
1. Data:
    - `Aves`: folder containing examples of the original photos divided in our 10 selected species
    - `data`: folder containing original original colored images and labels, both divided in Train, Val, Test folders
    - `data_bw`: folder containing black and white images and respective labels, divided in Train, Val, Test folders
    - `colorized`: folder containing examples of colorized images obtained with DeOldify GAN
    - `pickles`: folder containing pickles of the final dataframes for Train, Dev and Test, obtained in the _data_processing.ipynb_ notebook
2. SATM:
    - `preprocess.py`: set of functions used to handle and preprocess data from iNaturalis dataset
    - `dataset.py`: set of methods and classes used in the datasets creation for training Faster R-CNN model
    - `inference.py`: set of methods and classes broadly used in the inference phase of the project
3. Plots:
    - `plots`: folder containing plots obtained in the inference phase for our models
4. Data preprocessing and visualization:
    - `data_processing.ipynb`: jupyter notebook of initial preprocessing steps to obtained the final dataframes we will use for our modles
    - `data_visualization.ipynb`: jupyter notebook for exploratory analysis and visualization
5. Faster R-CNN:
    - `Faster_training.ipynb`: jupyter notebook containing the training code for Faster R-CNN 
    - `Faster_inference.ipynb`: jupyter notebook containing the inference code for Faster R-CNN
6. Yolov7:
    - `YOLO_training_inference.ipynb`: jupyter notebook containing the training and inference code for YOLOv7

## Our Task
- Object Detection

## Dataset
The dataset was retrieved on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/inaturalist-challenge-at-fgvc-2017) and we decided to focus on the Aves species. We divided the dataset in the following way:
- Training: 22000 images and 25000 boxes (check!)
- Validation: 22000 images and 3000 boxes (check!)
- Test: 22000 images and 3000 boxes (check!)

Here below a sample image for each of the 10 aves species we selected.
